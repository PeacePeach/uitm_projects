# DSC722: Research Methodology  
  
## Introduction  
  
Breast cancer is the most common and deadliest cancer for women worldwide (Oeffinger, K., Fontham, E., Etzioni, R., et al, 2015). Early detection followed by a treatment is vital to increase the chance of survival of a breast cancer patient. 

Studies have shown that applying machine learning techniques on biopsy result can reduce the human and technical errors and hence increasing the overall accuracy of the biopsy (Sheikhpour, R., Sarram, M., Sheikhpour, R., 2015). This paper will compare the accuracy of breast cancer prediction using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree.  
  
## Objectives  
  
To compare the accuracy of breast cancer detection thru FNA biopsy between three different classification techniques:  
  
  1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  3. Decision Tree  
  
## Results  
| Machine Learning Model             | Accuracy | Precision |
| ---------------------------------- |:--------:| --------- |
| SVM (RBF)                          | 98.82%   | 96.83%    |
| SVM (Polynomial)                   | 95.29%   | 92.06%    |
| ANN (1 hidden layer and 1 neurons) | 96.47%   | 95.16%    |
| ANN (1 hidden layer and 6 neurons) | 97.64%   | 95.31%    |
| Decision Tree                      | 92.94%   | 90.48%    |
